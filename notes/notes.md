throughput vs time


1. Epsilon: ratio between exploiting and exploration
1a: throughput/latency vs epsilon graph

2. Delta time: A graph between optimal latency vs delta time. Where optimality 

3. CDF vs latency. CDF vs throughput 

4. What is the base performance without the machine learning models


Add tickers to the plots / Use discontinuous lines



Images - v3
1. Generated after running predict/collect on tm.lte.short, vz.lte.short, att.lte.driving traces and generated iperf json outputs
